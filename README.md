# world-quiz
## Purpose of the project
The project is a quiz intended for kids from the age of 6 years old and above. It is a responsive game, displaying various locations around the world and the aim is for the player to guess correctly where this is. The style is colourful and easy to navigate.

## User stories
- As a visiting user I would like to view the instructions.
- As a new user I would like to access the game by clicking "Start" and I would like to learn the rules by clicking "How to play?"
- As a new user I would like to play an interactive game, which is responsive on all devices.

## Features
#### Heading:
A big and clear heading called "World quiz".
#### Question section:
A question asking the user where in the world they think a place is located.
#### Question Image:
The image is underneath the question and shows the player a remote location which is used to guess the correct answer.
#### Answer options:
Under the image section there are 3 answer options. The user has to pick one - this follows a message confirming if the answer was correct or not.
#### Next button:
- An overlay message appears with the sign "Correct" or "Incorrect...sorry". The user presses the next button after picking their location of choice. 
- Both correct and incorrect slides have a "next question" button, which leads to the next question.
#### Congratulations page:
- After the user answers their last question this leads to a "congratulations" message.
An "End quiz" button will take the player back to the main page with "Start" and "How to play".

## Future features
- Scoring - the user will receive a score of their correctly answered questions at the end of the quiz.
- Timer - the quiz will be timed from the moment the player clicks "Start" to the moment where they click "Submit" on the last question.

## Typography and color scheme
- The main colours in this project are blue an green to make the buttons stand out and make the game more intuitive. 
- The answer options are always a light green colour and the "next question" buttons are all a neutral blue.
