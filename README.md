## Features
#### Heading:
A big and clear heading called "World trip quiz"
#### Question section:
A question asking the user where in the world they think a place is located
#### Question Image:
The image is underneath the question and shows the player a remote location which is used to guess the correct answer.
#### Answer options:
Under the image section there are 3 answer options. The user has to pick one - this follows a message confirming if the answer was correct or not.
#### Submit button:
- The user presses the submit button after picking their location of choice. An overlay message appears with the sign "Correct" or "Incorrect...sorry".
- The Correct option leads to a button saying "Next question"
The incorrect option leads to the message "Incorrect...sorry" and the user can access a button saying "Next Question".
- After the user answers their last question this leads to a "congratulations" message and shows the player's score.
An "End quiz" button will take the player back to the main page with "Start" and "How to play".

## Future features
- Scoring - the user will receive a score of their correctly answered questions at the end of the quiz.
- Timer - the quiz will be timed from the moment the player clicks "Start" to the moment where they click "Submit" on the last question.
